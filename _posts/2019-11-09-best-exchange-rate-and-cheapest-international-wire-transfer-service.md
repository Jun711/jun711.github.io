Ever feel that it costs quite a bit to send money overseas. Check out this tool and save money on your next international wire transfer.

## TransferWise
> TransferWise is a British online money transfer service founded in January 2011 by Estonians Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus and is based in London. The company supports more than 750 currency routes across the world including GBP, USD, EUR, AUD and CAD, and provides multi-currency accounts.

## Mid Market Rate
TransferWise facilitates international currency exchange using mid market rate which is the rate we see on Google, XE and Yahoo Finance.

When we check currency exchange rates at banks, currency exchange shops or websites, we can see that each currency has "buy" and "sell" rates. These are the rates that currency exchange service providers willing to trade at. The rates they use determine the cost of our currency exchange and international wire transfer. 

For example, you can check [TD Bank's foreign exchange calculator](https://tool.td.com/fxcal/#/fxcalculator){:target="view_window"}

Logically, mid market rate is then the middle rate between buying and selling prices of currency markets.  

> The mid-market rate is an exchange rate unlike any other. It's the real one.

> In the world's currency markets, traders define the rates at which they are willing to "buy" or "sell" a specific currency. The mid-market rate is simply the midpoint between demand and supply for a currency, and because of that, it changes all the time.

But that's as technical as you need to get. The most important thing to know is that the mid-market rate is considered the fairest exchange rate possible.

The mid-market rate isn't a secret either. Its the rate you will find on independent sources such as Google, XE and Yahoo Finance.
