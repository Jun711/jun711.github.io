This book by Dale Cargenie is really great! The ways on how to make new friends suggested in this book are really practical and useful. I have learnt a great deal from this book such as identifying my mistakes on communicating and connecting with people, maintaining friendship, creating new connections&nbsp;et cetera.<br />Thus, I would like to share the summary and recommend this book to you.<br /><h3>Summary</h3><div><br /></div>
